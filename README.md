vim-password-vault
==================

Tired of writing down your password somewhere? 
Frustrated by those fancy gui-oriented password managers?

How about a plain text file, strongly encrypted, easyly to navigate,
with the tool you know best?

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) supports strong encryption via the "-x" option,
and the in-file configuration of some security-relevant vim-settings.
Here you find such a password file [.vault](blob/master/.vault)
and an optional vimrc snippet.

## Usage

```bash
vim -x .vault
```
